# Student-Debt-Cataloger
This program asks the user to insert a list of students identified by their Red ID along with their total debt. This program allocates a Student's Red ID and total debt into a list that is later sorted. It is sorted based on the total debt,  and is adjusted so that it goes from lowest to largest debt. Each debt is associated with the student's Red ID number.
